# Project management

### Expectation
The Developer is able to use a project management tool to effectively manage the work done by a team of developers by working with them to ensure that all tasks are identified & tracked, that changes are updated on stories, and that statuses are effectively used to keep everyone informed.

### Justification
I have used Trello board, Pivotal Tracker, Bugzilla, Gitlab issue tracker, and Jira so far for different projects.
Currently, on my engagement we use Jira and I find it very sophisticated. It gives us the power to track tickets and see how far a developer is with his assigned tasks. When I am creating a ticket, I try to be as descriptive as possible, especially with bugs and provide contexts. As I progress with a ticket, I move it from one column to another till it is done. Say from: To do -> In progress -> Review -> QA/UAT -> Ready for production -> Done.

I have also managed a team where Pivotal tracker was used. I enjoined team members to create tasks and be as descriptive as possible and assign story points.
