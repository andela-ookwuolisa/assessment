# Object Oriented Programming

### Expectations
The Developer should have a very sound understanding of object relationships and be able to use this knowledge to design a complete system, taking into account the different possible users and interactions.

### Justification
Object-oriented programming paradigm comes to play from the planning phase of a system. It is during this phase we define the high-level overview of the system, like Customers, Employees, Departments and so on. We call these entities classes and define how these classes interact with each other. After that, we define the variables each object will store. E.g, first_name, last_name, address and so on. These variables are called properties. After that, we can define the actions that these objects can perform. E.g make_payment, add_employee, remove_employee and so on. These actions are called methods. 

#### OOP concepts
- Inheritance: Inheritance describes how the attributes of base classes are inherited by the derived class. A subclass inherits attributes and methods from its parent class.
- Encapsulation: Encapsulation is when attributes and methods are stored in a single class. The process of providing a public interface to interact with the object while hiding other information inside the object. Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object's definition. 
- Abstraction: Abstraction allows programmers to write code that shows the essential features of a piece of software without including the background details.
- Polymorphism: polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. For example, given a base class shape, polymorphism enables the programmer to define different area methods for any number of derived classes, such as circles, rectangles and triangles. No matter what shape an object is, applying the area method to it will return the correct results.
