# Ownership

### Expectation
The Developer takes full ownership of delivering all work outputs as well as managing the team to deliver on work outputs within defined timelines. They also strive to ensure consistent delivery by resolving conflict amongst team members.

### Justification
On my current engagement, as the only Andela developer, I am putting extra work in making sure that my outputs are up to par with little margin for error. I constantly seek feedback and give recommendations when I am handed a task. Even when I am handed a task with an idea on how to go about it when I discover a better approach, I don't keep it to myself, I reach out to the team lead and share my findings. 

When I was an LFA, I ensured my team members did not spend too much time on a blocker. I guide them to resources to help unblock them so as not to delay output delivery.
