# API

### Expectation
The Developer should be able to design and build complex APIs using a number of protocols (REST, XML-RPC) taking into account backwards compatibility while being able to easily implement new features.

### Justification
REST: stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a simple way to organize interactions between independent systems. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make queries), and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations.

RPC: stands for Remote Procedure Calls. It basically allows clients to call procedures or functions on a remote server and get a response. In the case of XML-RPC, the response is in XML format and it is usually more verbose.
