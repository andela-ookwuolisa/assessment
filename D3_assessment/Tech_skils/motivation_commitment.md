# Motivation and commitment

### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of the team and is capable of motivating their team and maintaining their team's energy level and commitment throughout the course of a release or project.

### Justification
On my current engagement, just after a month of on-boarding, two senior engineers left the team. It came as a surprise because I did not see it coming. The two devs who left were the most senior and they usually take the heavy tasks. When they left, I and another teammate encouraged one another that it is life and such things happen. I worked harder o understand the codebase better. I started taking heavier tasks and contributing more actively to sprint planning. I jump on calls more frequently to unblock team members, and I communicated to teammates too when I am blocked. There was this new cohesiveness in our work. Although our output was lower initially, as we progressed through the months we began to measure up to previous output levels.
