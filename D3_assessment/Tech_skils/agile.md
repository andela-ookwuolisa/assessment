# Agile process

### Expectation
The Developer knows how to run daily standups, sprint planning sessions and retrospectives.

### Justification
I managed a small team as an LFA. I required my team members to post daily stand-ups on our team channel.
In my current team, we run daily stand-ups where each member gives an update on what he's working on. Also, we have a sprint planning session where we assign tasks. The tasks are weighed differently and are assigned as thus. The sprint lasts for ten days. We also do retros to look back on previous sprints to see how far we have come and if we are on track.
We use a Jira board to organize our tickets. Tickets in the backlog are placed according to relevance. And the most relevant are rolled into the newsprint
