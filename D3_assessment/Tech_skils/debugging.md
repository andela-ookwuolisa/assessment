# Debugging

### Expectation
The Developer is able to use their knowledge to facilitate root cause analysis across integrated components developed by the members of their team and external teams. They have the ability to diagnose problems by reverse engineering inherited code bases.

### Justification
Debugging is something I do quite often. In my current engagement, I have fixed lots of bugs. I do this by guessing the part of the code where the bug stems from and I narrow it down to the root cause after studying the code. I use the PDB module in python for debugging, and debugger in the browser console.

After fixing a bug, I write tests and ensure other components work well with the newly fixed bugged component.
