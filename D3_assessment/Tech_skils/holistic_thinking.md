# Holistic thinking

### Expectation
The Developer is able to understand the work that needs to be delivered by multiple members of a team, see how it all fits together toward the completion of a goal, and engage with stakeholders.

### Justification
On my current engagement, there is a complex feature we needed to add. In fact, it was an epic and was subdivided into sub tickets. I understood the big picture of the epic and I knew the role other devs had to play in delivering their subs tasks. When I was implementing my own sub task, I wasn't thinking in light of the subtask but in full awareness of the big picture. It helped in how I tailored my solution to best fit the epic.
Also when reviewing PRs I am able to ask questions to understand why a developer chose a certain implementation, and I am able to offer a better alternative if any exist. This is because I get to understand how this minute part all come together to form a unique feature.
