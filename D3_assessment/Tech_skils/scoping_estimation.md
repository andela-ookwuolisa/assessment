# Scoping and estimation
### Expectation
The Developer is able to facilitate the systematic breakdown of technical work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the Level of Effort (LOE) and the time required to complete the work.

### Justification
When a task is too complex, I break it into smaller chunks. Say if a task requires I work on models, views, and template. I split the task into three subtasks. Working on the model first, then views and template.

On my current engagement, I was once assigned a ticket on which another ticket was dependent on. I was asked to give a time estimate on when a PR would be raised and ready for a review. Having known the prerequisite to tackle the problem, I was able to give an accurate estimate for the feature to be ready.
Below is the strategy I used to come up with an estimate:
- I determine if a new tech would be required for me to learn to get the task done. e.g Libraries.
- I estimate the time for actual coding, depending on the complexity of the task and previous experience.
- I add time for writing unit tests
- I add extra time for miscellaneous
