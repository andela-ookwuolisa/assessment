# UI/UX

### Expectation
The Developer should be able to assist in the creation of UI/UX designs as well as suggest improvements on existing designs.

### Justification

On my previous engagement PineValey, I was among the three devs who contributed to building a good user interface. I was actively involved in cleaning up and modifying the React template used for the front end.
[Here is a front end app I built](https://news-feed-app-cp1-staging.herokuapp.com/#/?_k=7jsaqp)

Also, when making a change to the UI, I usually design a mockup (showing color choice and item positioning ) and present to my lead, for approval before going ahead with the implementation.
