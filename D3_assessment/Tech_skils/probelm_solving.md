# Problem solving

### Expectation
The Developer is able to display logical reasoning by drawing inferences that can be correlated to facts gathered, and prediction by extrapolating potential outcomes of solutions to identify risks and unintended consequences.

### Justification
On my current engagement, part of our discussions in a sprint was on how to optimize our app. I suggested using database caching and even went ahead with implementation and testing. Performance and speed increased but I was able to predict that although performance had improved significantly, it wasn't the best solution to optimize our code. That is because with caching, data won't be updated in real time and users in different systems would have conflicting data which would introduce bugs. Rather, we decided to optimize our database query and reformat code to remove unnecessary loops.
