# Decision making

### Expectation
The Developer is able to facilitate group discussions and decision-making. They do this by controlling the flow of dicussions, keeping everyone on track, ensuring that all relevant points are made and weighed as needed, and making sure the group is able to reach consensus.

### Justification

My previous engagement was a start-up. Often times during a whiteboarding session we decide on which technology to use. Like the decision to use a prepared template over writing a UI from scratch. We considered cost, time, and scalability and we settle for a compromise. Writing a UI from scratch would cost us more in terms of developer time, and take a longer time to bring to perfection. But it would help us scale better than a prepared template. But with a template, we could get closer to releasing an MVP, but with a hindrance of updating the template dependencies when it is outdated. We eventually agreed on the template because priority was on the backend and not the frontend, and that is where developer power needed to be channeled to.
