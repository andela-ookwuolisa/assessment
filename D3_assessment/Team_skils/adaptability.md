# Adaptability

## Expectation
The Developer is able to help other members of their team adapt to change and recognise its value.

## Justification
The latest addition to my team is from a data science background and has not done much of web apps. I was instrumental in making sure he had a smooth transitioning. Showing him our process, and best practice. 

During his first weeks, I reviewed his PR and often comment on them, asking the question behind his thought process and suggesting a better approach. Told him about our practice of writing tests when a task was done.
