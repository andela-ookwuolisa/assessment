# Reading to Understand
## Expectation
The Developer is able to identify and convey the key points of material and content read. They are adept at reading documentation, code, or emails and deriving all required information from them.

## Justification
My on-boarding wasn't the best. I had to rely on reading the project documentation and studying the codebase to get a clearer understanding of the project and how it works. 

Most tickets I have worked on, whether bug or feature comes with descriptive texts. I read the description and understand what the ticket entails before coding.

Many times during the course of implementing a task, I use unfamiliar technology and before that, I read the documentation of the technology. An example was when I used openpyxl. I read the docs and read how to test it.
