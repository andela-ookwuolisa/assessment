# Business Tools

## Expectation
The Developer knows when to use different business tools to solve their problem and depict information to make their team more connected. They know what tools are most useful given their goals and what they are trying to accomplish.

## Justification
On my current engagement, we use several tools to get the team connected and communicate better. Some of the business tools are:

- Outlook mail
- Zulip
- Jitsy
- Jira
- Bitbucket
- Confluence
- Zoom
- Calendar

And I know how and when to use each tool as appropriate.
