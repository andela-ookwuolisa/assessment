# Relationship Building

### Expectation
The Developer has the ability to establish themselves as a trusted advisor to their company. Leadership sees them as having the company's best interest at hand and capable of giving unbiased advice.

### Justification
Relationship building for me involves bonding with people notwithstanding religious, cultural, education and social status differences. It involves listening, having conversations around formal as well as informal topics.

When I traveled to my team's physical office, I bonded with stakeholders and we discussed the business model, some history on how the business started, and the team's methods. I was asked by my team lead what I felt they could improve on, and I gave some suggestions on how they could improve on documentation. Away from formal discussions, we also talked about culture and I was delighted to tell them about Nigeria. This has helped build the trust I have with them, and the trust they have for me.
