# Accountability

## Expectation
The Developer guides others on the team about the importance of taking responsibility and accounting for one's actions.

## Justification
When I was an LFA, I encouraged team members to take ownership of the project, and not just concerned about their assigned tasks only. I do this by:
- Making sure they collaborate
- Rotating chores
- Giving them an avenue to learn and grow.
- Making them trustworthy.

I also encourage them to own up to responsibilities and let them know they have a stake in the project as well. And when there is a mistake, the person who made the mistake should first of all attempt to fix the mistake, and when he cannot, raise an alarm.
