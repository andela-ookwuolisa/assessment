# Speaking to be Understood

## Expectation
The Developer speaks in a manner (audibility, pace) that allows others to engage and understand. They are able to rephrase a concept using different perspectives or vocabulary in order to exhibit a thorough understanding of the subject. The Developer can present important information to teams and stakeholders they interact with frequently.

## Justification

Speaking is a skill I have improved significantly on over the years. Communicating with my teammates who are in a very different demographic is no longer a hindrance in doing my work because I speak clearly and I am able to express myself in more than one way. I have improved on this skill through:
- Sprint planning/retro calls: This is when I give an update on my task, communicating the progress or blocker as the case may be.
- Ono-on-ones with team lead: This is when I have a one-on-one meeting with my team lead, giving her an update on my task and sharing ideas.
- Practice: As I practice on speaking, I become better at it.
- Listening: As I listen to my teammates, I become better at articulation.
- Asking questions when not clear.
