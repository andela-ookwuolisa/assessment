# Self-awareness
### Expectation
The Developer has a strong awareness of self and seeks feedback from others regarding their actions and behaviours. They continuously seek to improve weak areas. They make efforts to understand the behaviours of those around them, and make effective use of this understanding.

### Justification

Self-awareness is knowing and understanding your strength, weaknesses, character, and feelings. 
I like it when I solve my problems without any help from anyone. But when I joined the PineValley team, I had to make adjustments. I asked for help when faced with a blocker and even though deep down, I don't get the satisfaction I craved for by doing it all on my own, I still get a sense of satisfaction by delivering features in due time for the benefit of the business.

I have also had to make necessary adjustments to character when dealing with other team members, knowing fully well that human temperament differs.

My weak point is procrastination. But when I joined PineValley, I made sure to pick up tasks and work on them immediately. Although I was less involved in other social activities, the satisfaction from the partner and his positive feedback proved the sacrifice was worth it.

On my current engagement, I seek feedback from my TSM, Team Lead, and teammates, and act upon the feedback.
