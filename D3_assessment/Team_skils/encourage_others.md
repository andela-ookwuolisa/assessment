# Encourage Others
## Expectation
The Developer is able to give others support, confidence and hope. They can constructively persuade and stimulate others to continue something with strong work ethics. They show appreciation for the contributions of others, and give others credit for their work.

## Justification
- I displayed this skill almost on a daily basis. I give a thumbs up when a teammate is exceptional and I also give my team lead positive feedback as a form of encouragement. The most notable form of encouragement came into play when two senior devs left my team. I took it upon myself to encourage my teammate who was affected by the departure of two senior devs. I encouraged them by word of mouth, by my work output, and by telling them they are performing above my expectation.

- On my previous engagement, I and my teammates usually find time out to relax, away from work environments and discuss the project. This, in hindsight, is a form of encouragement.

- As always, when feedback is given to me, irrespective of nature, I appreciate the feedback because I know it is an avenue for me to improve. And my appreciation, the giver of the feedback would be encouraged to give another when necessary.
