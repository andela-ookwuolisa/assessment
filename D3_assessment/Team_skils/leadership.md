# Leadership

## Expectation
The Developer demonstrates additional leadership skills such as imparting knowledge and expertise to their team, helping them to understand what needs to be built and why, and encouraging a collaborative environment.

## Justification
On my current engagement, I have offered suggestions on how to improve the project. Like using caching, and changing the logic on how we display product statuses that will make fewer database queries and improve speed.

Also, I have exhibited leadership qualities as an LF, I admonish my team members to collaborate and learn from the feedback giving to other team members, motivating them and make sure they are well rounded on tech and team skills.

While I was an LF, I mentored prospective Andelans in boot camp. I knew they had varying skill level and I attended to each based on the level of skill. I reviewed their code, talked to them on seeing the bigger picture on any given problem and I also told them how to manage failure.
