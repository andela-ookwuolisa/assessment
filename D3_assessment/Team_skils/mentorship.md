# Mentorship

## Expectation
The Developer demonstrates an ability to coach knowledge-seeking developers in best practices in a manner that helps the mentee accelerate their knowledge and growth.

## Justification
As an LF at several boot camps, I have offered guidance to aspiring devs. 
While I was an LFA, when the boot-campers show me their blocker, we sit and discuss over the problem, during which I explain oblivious things and point them to materials where they can see useful info that would help in unblocking them. This was so done because as an LFA, I was not expected to code for them.
