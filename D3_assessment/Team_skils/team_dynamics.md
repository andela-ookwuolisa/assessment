# Team Dynamics

## Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of a team and how they are responsible not only for their own individual contributions, but mentoring other team members to increase the overall effectiveness of the team.

## Justification
I have provided assistance to my latest team member, having a one-on-one session, trying to get him past a blocker, reviewing PRs and giving feedback in ASK manner. 
Also as an LF, I have mentored my team members, explaining topics to them, and pointing them to resource to help them grow and become better developers. I know my team members, their strength and weaknesses. And I take this into consideration when assigning tasks. Also, I often pair them accordingly to foster growth and learning.
