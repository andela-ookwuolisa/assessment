# Empathy

### Expectation
The Developer is sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of people on their team. They also guide other members of their team to consider and respond appropriately to the needs and feelings of different people in different situations.

### Justification
I am aware of feelings. Feelings matter and if not treated with care can affect the productivity of the team. On my current engagement, I show empathy by:

- Being mindful of the tone I use in communicating
- Giving ASK feedback (Actionable, specific and kind)
- Being mindful of the reactions I use on a post
- Patiently walking a junior dev through a solution to a blocker without flaring
- Exercising patience when listening.
