# Focus & Concentration
### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of the team and knows how to keep his team focused on the client's top priorities but also knows when to stop pushing to avoid team or individual burnout.

### Justification
Whenever I am working and I feel it is taking me longer than required to understand something, I take a break. I leave my desk and walk around to clear my head and return to the task in minutes, sometimes hours, when my head is clear. I also do not risk burnout by not working on weekends. I do other fun things like playing table tennis.

As an LFA, I prioritize task for my team members so they don't get distracted by the not-so-important task. I also make sure they don't get stuck in a rabbit hole by not working on a task for too long if they are having difficulty.
