# Expectations Management
## Expectation
The Developer is able to manage the expectations of others regarding the output of the team as a whole and of individual members. They are also able to manage the expectations of the team themselves.

## Justification
I am always active in speaking out about blockers. Been relatively new on my team, I ask lots of questions and I leverage on the fact that I am new. When faced with a task with increasing complexities, I reach out to my teammates and update them on the latest status of things.

As an LFA, I constantly reach out to team members when their output does not meet the expectation. I do this bearing in mind that the team members are of different tech skills. So I  treat each according to each one's skill proficiency. Even when an output meets and exceeds expectation, I encourage the team member with such output.
