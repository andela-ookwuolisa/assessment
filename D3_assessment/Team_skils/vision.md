# Vision Alignment

## Expectation
The Developer is able to articulate their company's vision and understands how their work helps the company achieve their goals.

## Justification
Blick Arts Materials vision is to provide a one-stop shop for all art materials.

My work to help them achieve this is to make sure the price automation tool is at its best. If the products are not well priced, the company loses money or customers.
