# Management

## Expectation
The Developer demonstrates an ability to manage junior members of their team by clearly setting expectations, by helping them to improve as developers through the delivery of prioritised, value-adding work, and by helping them grow as contributing members of a technical team.

## Justification
I and three other devs were pre-placed on an engagement that requires we learned machine learning. Two of the devs were totally new to machine learning and were not so grounded in Python. I took it upon myself to get them through the basics of Matrix, Calculus, Pandas, and other basic things they needed to get the ground running with machine learning. We have weekly syncs where I share ideas and tips to propel them further.

The best approach to managing the devs to get better was showing examples and giving them freedom  to show what they can do. For instance, in training a dataset, I make sure my training model has high accuracy, and I make sure my code was reusable. And then let them do their stuff and give feedback.
