###SOLID principles
#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
A class should have only one reason to change.

#### Open Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

####Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

####Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
